I implemented this fast prototype with C# and Unity. 
One thing that I experimented in this build is level progression. Instead of moving cameras or creating multiple scenes, I chose to destroy the current tilemap and instantiate new ones as the player progresses to the next level. This helped me to avoid writing adaptive camera movement code for rooms of different sizes and also the trouble of saving player status between scenes.
